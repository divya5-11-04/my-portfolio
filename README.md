 # 🚀 Divya's Digital Portfolio

Welcome to my corner of the internet! This is the official repository of my personal portfolio website — a carefully crafted space where **code meets creativity**, and **projects meet purpose**.

## 🌟 About Me

I’m Divya, a passionate AI/ML engineer, full-stack developer, and problem solver who believes that technology should **solve real-world problems** — not just exist for its own sake. My work blends data-driven intelligence with design, reflecting who I am both as a **technologist** and as a **human**.
